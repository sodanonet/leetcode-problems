# Algorithmic Patterns

This directory contains implementations of common algorithmic patterns used in competitive programming and technical interviews. Each pattern includes both JavaScript and TypeScript implementations with comprehensive tests.

## Overview

Understanding algorithmic patterns is crucial for solving coding problems efficiently. These patterns provide a structured approach to tackle various types of problems by recognizing underlying similarities and applying proven techniques.

## Available Patterns

### 1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
**Files:** `bfs.js`, `bfs.ts`, `bfs.test.js`

**When to use:** Exploring graphs level by level, finding shortest paths in unweighted graphs, tree level order traversal.

**Key concepts:**
- Uses a queue data structure
- Explores all nodes at the current depth before moving to nodes at the next depth
- Guarantees shortest path in unweighted graphs

**Example use cases:**
- Finding shortest path in maze
- Level order tree traversal
- Social network connections (friends of friends)

### 2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
**Files:** `dfs.js`, `dfs.ts`, `dfs.test.js`

**When to use:** Exploring all possible paths, backtracking problems, detecting cycles, topological sorting.

**Key concepts:**
- Uses recursion or stack data structure
- Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking
- More memory efficient than BFS for deep trees

**Example use cases:**
- Maze solving with all paths
- Tree/graph traversal
- Cycle detection
- Topological sorting

### 3. **Divide and Conquer**
**Files:** `divide-and-conquer.js`, `divide-and-conquer.ts`, `divide-and-conquer.test.js`

**When to use:** Problems that can be broken into smaller subproblems, sorting algorithms, searching in sorted arrays.

## üîç How to Detect Which Pattern to Use

Learning to identify the right algorithmic pattern is a crucial skill. Here are detailed guidelines to help you recognize which pattern applies to different problem scenarios:

### üéØ Pattern Detection Framework

#### **Step 1: Analyze the Problem Structure**

**Data Structure Clues:**

#### **Step 2: Identify Problem Patterns**

### üîç Detailed Pattern Detection Guide

#### **üåä BFS Detection Signals**
```
‚úÖ Use BFS when you see:
- "Find shortest path" (unweighted)
- "Minimum number of steps/operations"
- "Level order traversal"
- "Nearest/closest" problems
- "Spreading" or "infection" scenarios

‚ùå Don't use BFS for:
- Finding ALL possible paths
- Weighted graphs (use Dijkstra instead)
- Deep recursion problems
```

**LeetCode Examples:** Binary Tree Level Order, Word Ladder, Rotting Oranges

#### **üåÄ DFS Detection Signals**
```
‚úÖ Use DFS when you see:
- "Find all paths/combinations/permutations"
- "Backtracking" problems
- "Generate all possible solutions"
- "Check if path exists" (any path)
- "Cycle detection"

‚ùå Don't use DFS for:

```

**LeetCode Examples:** Generate Parentheses, N-Queens, Word Search

#### **‚ö° Dynamic Programming Detection Signals**
```
‚úÖ Use DP when you see:
- "Maximum/minimum" with choices
- "Count number of ways"
- "Optimal substructure" + "overlapping subproblems"
- "Can be broken into similar smaller problems"
- Fibonacci-like recurrence relations

Key Questions:
1. Can I break this into smaller subproblems?
2. Do subproblems overlap?
3. Does optimal solution contain optimal solutions to subproblems?

‚ùå Don't use DP for:
- Greedy problems (local optimal = global optimal)
- Independent subproblems
```

**LeetCode Examples:** Climbing Stairs, House Robber, Longest Common Subsequence

```
‚úÖ Use D&C when you see:

‚ùå Don't use D&C for:
- Overlapping subproblems (use DP instead)

```

**LeetCode Examples:** Binary Search, Merge Sort, Quick Select

#### **üìä Frequency Counter Detection Signals**
```
‚úÖ Use Frequency Counter when you see:
- "Anagram" problems
- "Character/element frequency"
- "Compare two arrays/strings"

```

**LeetCode Examples:** Valid Anagram, Group Anagrams, Find All Anagrams

```
‚úÖ Use Greedy when you see:
- "Locally optimal choice leads to global optimum"
- "Activity selection" type problems
- "Interval scheduling"
- "Minimum coins" (certain denominations)

Key Question: Does making the best choice at each step guarantee the best overall solution?

‚ùå Don't use Greedy for:
- Problems requiring exploring all possibilities
- When local optimum ‚â† global optimum
```

**LeetCode Examples:** Jump Game, Gas Station, Meeting Rooms

#### **üîÑ Recursion Detection Signals**
```
‚úÖ Use Recursion when you see:
- "Tree/graph traversal"
- "Mathematical sequences" (factorial, fibonacci)
- "Self-similar" subproblems
- "Divide into smaller similar problems"

Key: Problem can be expressed as f(n) = operation(f(n-1), f(n-2), ...)
```

**LeetCode Examples:** Tree Traversals, Fibonacci, Tower of Hanoi

#### **ü™ü Sliding Window Detection Signals**
```
‚úÖ Use Sliding Window when you see:
- "Contiguous subarray/substring"
- "Maximum/minimum sum of subarray of size k"
- "Longest/shortest substring with condition"
- "Find all subarrays/substrings"

Fixed Window: Size is given
Variable Window: Size changes based on condition

‚ùå Don't use for:
- Non-contiguous elements
- Entire array processing
```

**LeetCode Examples:** Max Sum Subarray of Size K, Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

- "Reverse" operations
- "Merge" two sorted arrays

Patterns:
- Opposite Direction: left=0, right=n-1, move toward center
- Same Direction: slow and fast pointers

‚ùå Don't use for:
- Unsorted arrays (sort first, or use different approach)
- Single element processing
```

**LeetCode Examples:** Two Sum II, Valid Palindrome, Remove Duplicates

### üö¶ Decision Tree for Pattern Selection

```
Problem Analysis Flow:

1. Is it a graph/tree? ‚Üí BFS/DFS
   ‚îú‚îÄ Need shortest path? ‚Üí BFS
   ‚îî‚îÄ Need all paths/combinations? ‚Üí DFS

2. Is it an optimization problem?
   ‚îú‚îÄ Overlapping subproblems? ‚Üí Dynamic Programming
   ‚îú‚îÄ Local optimal = global optimal? ‚Üí Greedy
   ‚îî‚îÄ Independent subproblems? ‚Üí Divide and Conquer

3. Is it about arrays/strings?
   ‚îú‚îÄ Contiguous elements? ‚Üí Sliding Window
   ‚îú‚îÄ Two elements/positions? ‚Üí Two Pointers
   ‚îú‚îÄ Counting/comparing? ‚Üí Frequency Counter
   ‚îî‚îÄ Self-similar structure? ‚Üí Recursion
```

### üéÆ Practice Strategy

1. **Read the problem carefully** - Look for keywords and constraints
2. **Identify the core operation** - What are you trying to optimize/find?
3. **Consider the data structure** - Array, tree, graph, string?
4. **Check for patterns** - Does it fit any of the detection signals above?
5. **Verify with examples** - Does your chosen pattern work for given examples?

### üìö Pattern Combinations

Some problems may require **multiple patterns**:
- **DFS + Memoization** = Dynamic Programming
- **BFS + Two Pointers** = Some shortest path problems
- **Sliding Window + Frequency Counter** = Substring problems with character constraints
